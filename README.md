TiltSpot 
========================

It's a modified version of the "TiltSpot" app from the [Advanced Android Development Course](https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/google-developer-training/android-developer-advanced-course-concepts/details) which gives support to devices that not have magnetic field sensor (like the Moto G 5 in my case) using Gyroscope sensor instead.

The respective dark circles are reoriented when the screen orientation changes, by remaping the coordinate system of the sensor.
